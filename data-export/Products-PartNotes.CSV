245594,DIRECTIONS OF USE,ALL BRANCHES,25/08/2016 00:00:00,C,RE,Spring washers are a left hand helix and allow the thread to be tightened in a right hand direction only&#44 i.e. a clockwise direction. When a left hand turning motion is applied&#44 the raised edge bites into the underside of the bolt or nut and the part that it is bolted to&#44 thus resisting turning. Therefore&#44 spring washers are ineffective on left hand threads and hardened surfaces. Also&#44 they are not to be used in conjunction with a flat washer under the spring washer&#44 as this isolates the spring washer from biting into the component that will resist turning. Where a flat washer is required to span a large hole in a component&#44 a nyloc nut (nylon insert) must be used.

When a left hand turning motion is applied&#44 the raised edge bites into the underside of the bolt or nut and the part that it is bolted to&#44 thus resisting turning. Therefore&#44 spring washers are ineffective on left hand threads and hardened surfaces. Also&#44 they are not to be used in conjunction with a flat washer under the spring washer&#44 as this isolates the spring washer from biting into the component that will resist turning. Where a flat washer is required to span a large hole in a component&#44 a nyloc nut (nylon insert) must be used.

990200,DIRECTIONS OF USE,ALL BRANCHES,25/08/2016 00:00:00,C,RE,GRAVIGARD stone chip protector can be used on the following surfaces:-<br/>- Suitably prepared&#44 primed or bare metal.<br/>For overcoating aluminium&#44 an etch primer is recommended.- Original paint surfaces (with the exception of thermoplastic acrylics).<br/>Thoroughly clean and degrease old paint surfaces with a suitable spirit wipe or thinner. Wet flat with 400 grade paper. For bare metal use 180 grade paper. Re-clean and dry.<br/>Shake the can before use. Spray the GRAVIGARD at a distance of 20-30 cm from the panel being coated.<br/>Build: One coat of GRAVIGARD will give a build of approximately 35 microns. Varying the distance of the can from the panel during spraying will give a flatter or bumpier effect. When building a thick coat&#44 allow approximately 10-15 mins. between coats for the solvent to flash off.<br/>Drying Time: Approximately 2 hours at normal shop temperature or 30 mins. at low bake (80ºC). Drying time is dependent on film thickness&#44 humidity and temperature.<br/>Over Painting: GRAVIGARD may be over-painted with most paint systems. With 2 pack acrylic paints it can be over-painted wet-on-wet. For optimum gloss the use of a primer is recommended.
